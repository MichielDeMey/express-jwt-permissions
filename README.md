Middleware that checks JWT tokens for permissions, recommended to be used in conjunction with [express-jwt](https://github.com/auth0/express-jwt).

## Install

```
npm install express-jwt-permissions --save
```

## Usage

This middleware assumes you already have a JWT authentication middleware such as [express-jwt](https://github.com/auth0/express-jwt).

The middleware will check a decoded JWT token to see if a token has permissions to make a certain request.

Permissions should be described as an array of strings inside the JWT token, or as a space-delimited [OAuth 2.0 Access Token Scope](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.3) string.

```json
"permissions": [
  "status",
  "user:read",
  "user:write"
]
```

```json
"scope": "status user:read user:write"
```

If your JWT structure looks different you should map or reduce the results to produce a simple Array or String of permissions.

### Using permission Array
To verify a permission for all routes using an array:

```javascript
var guard = require('express-jwt-permissions')()

app.use(guard.check('admin'))
```

If you require different permissions per route, you can set the middleware per route.

```javascript
var guard = require('express-jwt-permissions')()

app.get('/status', guard.check('status'), function(req, res) { ... })
app.get('/user', guard.check(['user:read']), function(req, res) { ... })
```

Logical combinations of required permissions can be made using nested arrays.

Single string
```js
// Required: "admin"
app.use(guard.check(
  'admin'
))
```

Array of strings

```javascript
// Required: "read" AND "write"
app.use(guard.check(
  ['read', 'write']
))
```

Array of arrays of strings

```javascript
// Required: "read" OR "write"
app.use(guard.check([
  ['read'],
  ['write']
]))

// Required: "admin" OR ("read" AND "write")
app.use(guard.check([
  ['admin'],
  ['read', 'write']
]))
```

### Configuration
To set where the module can find the user property (default `req.user`) you can set the `requestProperty` option.

To set where the module can find the permissions property inside the `requestProperty` object (default `permissions`), set the `permissionsProperty` option.

Example:

Consider you've set your permissions as `scope` on `req.identity`, your JWT structure looks like:

```json
"scope": "user:read user:write"
```

You can pass the configuration into the module:

```javascript
var guard = require('express-jwt-permissions')({
  requestProperty: 'identity',
  permissionsProperty: 'scope'
})

app.use(guard.check('user:read'))
```

## Error handling

The default behavior is to throw an error when the token is invalid, so you can add your custom logic to manage unauthorized access as follows:

```javascript
app.use(guard.check('admin'))

app.use(function (err, req, res, next) {
  if (err.code === 'permission_denied') {
    res.status(403).send('Forbidden');
  }
});
```

**Note** that your error handling middleware should be defined after the jwt-permissions middleware.

## Excluding paths

This library has integration with [express-unless](https://github.com/jfromaniello/express-unless) to allow excluding paths, please refer to their [usage](https://github.com/jfromaniello/express-unless#usage).

```javascript
const checkForPermissions = guard
  .check(['admin'])
  .unless({ path: '/not-secret' })

app.use(checkForPermissions)
```

## Tests

```
$ npm install
$ npm test
```
